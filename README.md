# littleInfernoSurvey
My first project (completed in 2022 as part of freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Wed Design" certification :)
the "draft" files just use an alternate font which i preffered more but couldnt figure out how to use when submitting the code to FCC. "little inferno survey" contains the files i ended up submitting instead(with the alternate font).
